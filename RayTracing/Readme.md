#RayTracing
Thanks to FTB for this excellent software.

This is the original site where I find the source: (https://macsbug.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/raytracing-with-esp32/)

I made the porting for Keil, using mixed environment: C and C++.
See (http://blog.embeddednotes.org/#raytrace_blog) for detail.

The rendeing run on full-screen at 0.87 seconds and at 320x240 of resolution at 0.54 seconds. 

The projects run on my computer under this path:

C:\Keil_v5\ARM\Pack\Keil\STM32F7xx_DFP\2.2.0\Projects\STM32746G-Discovery\Applications\FatFs
